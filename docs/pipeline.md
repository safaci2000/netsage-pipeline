The NetSage Pipeline

1. "Testpoints" or "sensors" collect flow data (tstat, sflow, or netflow) and send it to a "pipeline host" for processing (for globanoc, flow-proc.bldc.grnoc.iu.edu or netsage-probe1.grnoc.iu.edu).
Tstat data goes directly into the netsage_deidentifier_raw queue rabbit queue. The other data is written to nfcapd files.

2. A netsage-netflow-importer-daemon reads any new nfcapd files that have come in after a configurable delay. 
	The importer aggregates flows within each file, 
	and writes the results to the netsage_deidentifier_raw queue rabbit queue.

Notes:
Importer config files are netsage_netflow_importer.xml and netsage_shared.xml in /etc/grnoc/netsage/deidentifer/. Comments in the files briefly describe the options.
Names of files have already been read are stored in /var/cache/netsage/netflow_importer.cache. 
The importer uses the nfdump command with -a to aggregate within the file, and -L <threshold> to throw out any flows under a flow size threshold. 
For cenic, data from the importer first goes into a ...prefilter queue. A netsage-flow-filter-daemon reads it out, removes some flows , then sends it to the ...raw queue.
A ...raw2 or ...fake queue is created for historical reasons but never actually holds any messages.

All flow data waits in the netsage_deidentifier_raw queue until it is processed by the logstash pipeline as follows.
These Logstash config files are in /etc/logstash/conf.d/.

3. 01-inputs.conf -  
	reads flows from wherever the user wants to get data; in our case, from the netsage_deidentifer_raw rabbit queue.

4. 10-preliminaries.conf - 
	drops flows to or from private IP addresses;	
	adds @injest_time; 
	converts any timestamps in milliseconds to seconds;
	drops events with timestamps more than a year in the past or (10 sec) in the future; 
	does some data type conversions

5. 20-add_id.conf - 
	adds a unique id based on the 5-tuple (src and dst ips and ports, and protocol) plus the sensor name. This ends up being called meta.id.

(30-xxx.conf is not used yet)

6. 40-aggregation.conf - 
	stitches together flows from different nfcapd files into longer flows, matching them up by meta.id and using a specified inactivity_timeout to decide when to start a new flow.

Notes:
By default, 5-minute nfcapd files are assumed, and if less than 10.5 min have passed between the start of the current flow and the start of the last matching one, stitch the two together.
Your logstash pipeline can have only 1 worker or aggregation is not going to work! 

7. 50-geoip-tagging.conf - 
	if the destination IP is in the multicast range, sets the destination Organization, Country, and Continent to "Multicast";
	queries the MaxMind GeoLite2-ASN database by IP to get src and dst Organizations (note that these are the organizations associated with the ASN);   
	if the ASN in the flow header differs from that which MaxMind gives, the flow header's value is saved [we need to not do this if it's a private ASN];  
	queries the MaxMind GeoLite2-City database by IP to get src and dst Countries, Continents, Latitudes, and Longitudes. 

8. 55-member-orgs.conf - 
	[this part is commented out right now: if a src or dst ASN matches a certain value, search only the corresponding lookup table.]
	Search lookup tables by IP to obtain member or customer organization names and overwrite the GeoIP ASN Organization where applicable.
	This allows us to have entities which don't own their own ASs be listed as the src or dst Organization.

Notes:
Lookup tables are not stored in github.

9. 60-scireg-tagging-fakegeoip.conf -
	uses a fake geoip database containing Science Registry information to add,  for src and dst, science discipline and role, science registry organization and location, etc;
	removes scireg fields we don't actually need to save to elasticsearch.

Notes:
The science registry fake geoip database can be downloaded from scienceregistry.grnoc.iu.edu via a cron job. 

10. 65-preferred-location-org.conf -
	copies science registry organization and/or location values, if they exist, to the preferred_organization and/or perferred_location fields.

11. 70-deidentify.conf - 
	replaces the last octet of IPv4 addresses and the last 4 hextets of IPv6 addresses with x's in order to deidentify them. 

12. 80-privatize.org.conf -
	removes information about Australian organizations (or, with modification, any organization that has privacy rules that require us not to identify them).
	If the ASN is one listed, completely replaces the IP with x's, sets the location to central Autralia, sets all organizations to "AARNet", removes all Projects.

13. 90-additional-fields.conf -
	sets additional quick and easy fields. The first 2 use lookup files based on regexes.  Currently we have:
	sensor_group  = TACC, AMPATH, etc
	sensor_type    = Circuit, Archive, Exchange Point, or Regional Network 
	country_scope = Domestic, International, or Mixed

14. 95-cleanup.conf -
	does small misc. tasks at the end like rename, remove, or convert fields

15. 99-outputs.conf -
	adds @exit_time and @processing_time,
	sends results to whereever the user wants them to go. In our case, it sends them to the netsage_archive_input queue (or netsage_ilight_input, etc) on netsage-elk1.grnoc.iu.edu. 

16. In our case, OmniSOC manages the last stage. Their logstash [running on ?] reads flows from the netsage_archive_input queue and sends it into elasticsearch. The indices are named like om-ns-netsage-YYYY.mm.dd-* (or om-ns-ilight-*, etc).
